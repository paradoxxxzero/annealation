This is a real time 2, 3 and 4 dimensions N-body gravity simulation rendered with [three.js](https://threejs.org/) (and [four.js](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/four.js)!) using optimized javascript and wasm rust backends for the direct point to point (p2p) method and the [barnes-hut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation) (bh) algorithm.
